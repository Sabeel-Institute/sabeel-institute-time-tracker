/**
 * Does the signed-in account still exist on the server?
 *
 * While a new account waits for its profile, two very different things look
 * the same from the client: the onUserCreate trigger has not finished (a cold
 * start can take tens of seconds), or it has DELETED the account (an address
 * outside the institute). Only the second may be told "This app is for Sabeel
 * Institute accounts only", and only Auth can say which it is.
 *
 * Asked of Identity Toolkit's `accounts:lookup` directly, with the session's
 * current ID token (still valid for a deleted account: nothing revokes it),
 * rather than through `user.reload()`, which asks the same thing but signs the
 * person out on the answer, taking away the screen that would tell them why.
 * A deleted account answers `USER_NOT_FOUND` in production and on the Auth
 * emulator alike.
 *
 * `unknown` when the question could not be answered (offline, a server
 * error): never read as a refusal.
