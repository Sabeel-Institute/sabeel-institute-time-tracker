# Free the Firebase emulator ports, killing whatever still holds them.
#
# Why this exists: a killed or crashed run leaves emulators squatting on these
# ports. The next run then talks to a HALF-DEAD emulator — one that answers on
# the port but has no functions registered — and every callable 404s. In the
# browser that surfaces as "blocked by CORS policy" (a 404 carries no CORS
# headers) and the app shows a bare "internal", so the symptom points at the
# app, not at the leftover process. Cost hours on 2026-07-20.
#
# Look up owners BY PORT, never `pkill -f firebase`: a pattern like that also
# matches this script's own command line (and the agent shell that spawned it),
# so the "cleanup" kills the caller — observed as a shell exiting with 144.
